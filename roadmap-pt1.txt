CONSCIOUSNESS APP ROADMAP - PART 1
======================================

IMPLEMENTED TODOS:
-----------------
✅ generating training data
   - Real-time TrueRNG V3 integration for quantum noise
   - EEG data capture from Emotiv device
   - Color painting interface with swashes and lines
   - 3D curve interpretation (interlocking dials from circular segments)
   - Session recording and data logging

✅ training
   - Machine learning pipeline for color/dial prediction
   - Training on combined RNG + EEG + drawing data
   - Configurable time offset compensation for drawing delay
   - Model persistence and loading

✅ inference
   - Mode 1: RNG-only output generation
   - Mode 2: Combined RNG + EEG output generation
   - Real-time color and 3D dial prediction
   - Three oracles system (369 mode)
   - Port binding for multiple inference instances

NEXT TODOS:
----------
🔄 pocket_dimension
   - Implement pocket dimension number tracking system
   - Layer-based navigation controls:
     * Layer 1: Press 2 (+1), Press 3 (+2)
     * Layer 2: Press 1 (+1), Press 3 (-1)  
     * Layer 3: Press 1 (-1), Press 2 (-2)
   - UI display of current pocket dimension value
   - Integration with existing 3-layer system

🔄 recursive inference loop
   - Enable running inference "under" generation mode
   - Create nested consciousness simulation layers
   - Implement feedback loops where inference output becomes generation input
   - Technical recursive architecture for consciousness mapping
   - Stabilization algorithms for recursive convergence

FUTURE ARCHITECTURE NOTES:
-------------------------
- Advanced geometry generation from stabilized noise patterns

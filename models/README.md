# Models Directory

Trained PyTorch models are stored here but **not committed to git** (too large).

## What's Stored Here
- `*.pth` - PyTorch model checkpoints
- `*.pt` - PyTorch model files  
- `model_registry.json` - Model metadata (this IS committed)

## Model Files (Ignored by Git)
- `best_consciousness_model_pytorch.pth` - Best performing model
- Session-specific models from training runs
- Intermediate checkpoints

## Getting Models
Models are generated by running:
```bash
python run.py --mode train --data-dir data/
```

## Model Registry
The `model_registry.json` file tracks all trained models and their metadata.
This file IS committed to git so others can see what models exist.
